# ColliderScope

There will be a [Colliderscope](https://colliderscope.web.cern.ch/) concert on Saturday, July 23 at [Blue Moon](https://www.thebluemoonseattle.com/), Seattle's Most Infamous Dive Bar.

Members of the public and conference attendees over 21 years old are encouraged to come listen to, dance along with, and marvel at the DJ stylings and oscilliscope wonderment brought to you by Larry Lee.
